# Feature Engineering

## Problems without implementing the feature engineering
In designing the AI model, most time is consumed on cleaning the data, Here is the data from Fobes.

The success of the ML model depends very much on feature engineering, for example if X1 and X2 are the features that are captured in the original data, we can detrive new feature by extracing x1/x2 or the product X1*X2.
There are many innovating methods of derving the new features like binning continous variable,centring the data(deviation from the mean) and so on.

## What is feature engineering
It is the process of selecting,extracting and transforming most relevant features from the available data to build more accurate and efficent machine learning models


## Basic examples of Feature engineering
- Outlier Detection
- one hot encoding
- handling missing data
