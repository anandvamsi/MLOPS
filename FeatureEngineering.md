# Feature Engineering

## Problems without implementing the feature engineering
In designing the AI model, most time is consumed on cleaning the data, Here is the data from Fobes.

The success of the ML model depends very much on feature engineering, for example if X1 and X2 are the features that are captured in the original data, we can detrive new feature by extracing x1/x2 or the product X1*X2.
There are many innovating methods of derving the new features like binning continous variable,centring the data(deviation from the mean) and so on.

## What is feature engineering
It is the process of selecting,extracting and transforming most relevant features from the available data to build more accurate and efficent machine learning models
They key is that we need to



## Basic examples of Feature engineering
- Extracing day of the week from the timestamp ::- This can helps to findout the seonsal trips
- Extracting the hour from the timestam ::- can help hourly hits on the day
- From the Birthday, calculating the age  ::- helps in selling the products active predective targets
  
- Outlier Detection
- One hot encoding
- Handling missing data
