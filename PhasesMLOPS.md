# Phases in MLOPS


## Phase 2
### Data cleaning
- Handling null values
- handling outliners
- handling duplicates

#### Note:  if the outliners exist, model cannot learn the pattern.
More chances is "Underfitting of the model" means the model will less high accuracy 
- un formated values into formatted values example if date is in different format.
- deduplication 
    

## phase 3
### Data prepration 
- Prepare matrices depends on types of ML
- supervised learning X- Features and Y-Labesl
- UnSupervised Learning Only X features
- Reinforced learning
    ### Two Matrices
    - E (Environement/Rule)
    - Q (Knowledge matrix)


 #### Best practices of Data preparation
 - Data Scaling
 - Divide the data into two parts
     - Training the data(60-80%)
     - Test data (30-20%)
