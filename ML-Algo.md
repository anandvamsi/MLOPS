# Different types of Algos in ML.

## Supervised Learning.
Supervised learning is like teaching a computer using examples. You provide the computer with a bunch of data that has the correct answers (labels), and it learns from those examples.
For instance, if you want the computer to recognize pictures of cats and dogs, you show it many pictures along with labels telling it which is which. The computer then learns the differences between cats and dogs based on those labeled pictures.
Once it's trained, you can give it a new picture, and it will try to guess if itâ€™s a cat or a dog based on what it learned. Essentially, it's learning from known examples to make predictions about new, unseen data!

### UseCases of Supervised learning

```Email Classification:``` Classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam" based on labeled examples of each.

```Image Recognition:``` Identifying objects in pictures, like classifying photos as containing "cats," "dogs," or "cars" based on labeled images.

```Sentiment Analysis:``` Analyzing customer reviews to determine if they are positive, negative, or neutral based on labeled text samples.

```Credit Scoring:``` Predicting whether a loan applicant will default on a loan based on historical data about past borrowers.

```Sales Forecasting:``` Predicting future sales based on historical sales data and features like seasonality, promotions, and econom``````ic indicators.

```Medical Diagnosis:``` Using patient data to predict whether someone has a certain disease, based on previous cases with known outcomes.

```Weather Prediction:``` Forecasting whether it will rain or be sunny based on historical weather data.

These examples illustrate how supervised learning can be applied in various fields to make predictions and classify data!


### common Algorithms of Supervised Learning
--------------------------------------------
- Linear Regression: For regression tasks.
- Logistic Regression: For binary classification.
- Decision Trees: For both classification and regression.
- Random Forest: An ensemble method for classification and regression.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): For classification tasks.
- Neural Networks: For complex patterns in both classification and regression.
