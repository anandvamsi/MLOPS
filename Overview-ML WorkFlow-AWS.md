These steps help guide the process from gathering data to evaluating and deploying a model for use.

Common ML vs Custom ML
when solving an inventory management issue, you may use ML to implement demand forecasting to increase efficiency in your operations. 
Once there is a clear need and we have adequately understood the problem, we must determine if it can be addressed by a common ML solution or one that needs custom development.
The following table guides you on the common problem types for which AWS provides pre-trained ML models called AWS AI services by means of an API that you can easily include in your application without having to worry about model training.
