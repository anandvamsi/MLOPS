# MLOPS
- why do we need  MLOPS
-  what is MLOPS, what is predictive AI and generative AI
- Goal of MLOPS

EDA ::- Exploratory Data Analysis , More like getting data from SQL, different teams

 - Stage 1: Data Prepration
   - Every thing starts with data
   - Better the quality of the data better the model
     
   
 - Stage 2: Training with data; Bulding the model; more of experimentation 
     - Building the model
         - Feature selection/generation
         - Algo selection
         - Hyperparmater tuning
         - Fiting the model
           
 - Stage 3: Deployment
   
 - Stage 4: Monitoring
     - Performance and Latency
     - Model drift::- 

Traditionally all the above stages are done manually;

MLOps, a fusion of “machine learning” and “operations,” refers to the set of practices and processes aimed at streamlining the development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models in production environments

Another ways is , MLOPS is a set of standard processes and capabilites  for building,deploying and operationlizing ML system ```rapidly``` and ```reliably```.

### Non-generative AI = Predictive AI
Predictive AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on performing specific tasks or solving specific problems.
```It doesn't have the ability to create new content or generates original ideas.```
Instead, it relies on preexisting data and algorithms to make predictions like classification/decision
For example, regression, classification, object detection, or forecasting tasks can be listed as predictive A.I. tasks Within the AI


### Generative AI
Creating new and original content such as text, images or music by learning from patterns in existing data.



MLOPS implements Devops Principles,Devops tools and practices into machine learning workflow
Both the deployment and training phase will Automated with CI/CD
MLOPS is all  practices that is seamless handoff between Data Scientist and ML engineer

Teams collabrate to build,automate,etst and monitor the machine learning pipelines more like Devops Project.

## Goal of MLOPS
- Faster Experimentation and model deployment
- Faster deployment of updated models into production
- Quality Assurance
- Monitoring
- Validation
- Goverance 

## Best practices of MLOPS
- Create models with resuable ML pipelines
- Automation is key for robust MLOPS
- Monitor perforamance
- Monitor data drift and utilize the insights to retrain the model
- Enable automatic audit rails creation for all artifacts.

# MLOPS for GenAI
A set of practices,techiniques and technologies that expland MLOPS for operationalizing generative AI applications

## what is Experimentatin

In the context of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), experimentation refers to the process of conducting controlled tests or trials to evaluate different machine learning models, algorithms, hyperparameters, feature engineering techniques, and data preprocessing methods. The goal of experimentation is to iteratively improve the performance and effectiveness of machine learning models by systematically testing hypotheses and exploring various configurations.
