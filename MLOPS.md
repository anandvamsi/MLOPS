# MLOPS
- why do we need  MLOPS
-  what is MLOPS
- Goal of MLOPS

EDA ::- Exploratory Data Analysis , More like getting data from SQL, different teams

 - Stage 1: Data Prepration
   - Every thing starts with data
   - Better the quality of the data better the model
     
   
 - Stage 2: Training with data; Bulding the model; more of experimentation 
     - Building the model
         - Feature selection/generation
         - Algo selection
         - Hyperparmater tuning
         - Fiting the model
           
 - Stage 3: Deployment
   
 - Stage 4: Monitoring
     - Performance and Latency
     - Model drift::- 

Traditionally all the above stages are done manually;

MLOPS implements Devops Principles,Devops tools and practices into machine learning workflow
Both the deployment and training phase will Automated with CI/CD
MLOPS is all  practices that is seamless handoff between Data Scientist and ML engineer


## Goal of MLOPS
- Faster Experimentation and model deployment
- Faster deployment of updated models into production
- Quality Assurance
- Monitoring
- Validation
- Goverance 

## Best practices of MLOPS
- Create models with resuable ML pipelines
- Automation is key for robust MLOPS
- Monitor perforamance
- Monitor data drift and utilize the insights to retrain the model
- Enable automatic audit rails creation for all artifacts.
